I'm not trying to ruin your fun
You're just a little bit late
I guess you're already done
It's this feeling I can't shake
It's up to you
I'm never doing the right thing
So I'm so stuck
If you see me in America
I might say hi
But if you meet me out in Europe
I'm a talkative guy
Maybe we'll talk over scones
Or I'll fuck sometimes
And I've never been a friend
So it might be nice
But I can't take this pop around
See, she's just like a camera
Always out and always staring at me
And if I say the wrong thing
Like I want thoughts of it
Always looking at the pitchforks
With you trying to speak
It's beginning to be me
This day I'm walking the road
Kicking rocks, it's my fault
My life's the way story talks
I'll be this way till I'm home
I rip the page out the book
I'm not trying to ruin your fun
Just some misunderstood
I always think I've never
Know when my life felt good
I smoke a cig on the porch
It doesn't hurt me at all
I wonder what's it all for
Is this the girl I adore?
And I know I can't afford
Watching her walk out the door
So I keep it to myself
And keep my feet on the floor
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
I'm not trying to be a fool
